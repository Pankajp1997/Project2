# AWS Lambda Snapshot Management

## Overview:
The AWS Lambda Snapshot Management project is a serverless solution designed to automate the cleanup of unused Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) snapshots within an AWS environment. Leveraging the power of AWS Lambda and the Boto3 Python library, this project addresses the challenge of optimizing storage costs by identifying and deleting snapshots that are not associated with any volumes or instances. 

### Serverless Architecture: 
The project utilizes AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service, to execute the snapshot management functions. This ensures cost-effectiveness, scalability, and minimal operational overhead.

### Boto3 Integration: 
Boto3, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, is employed to interact with AWS services. Specifically, it enables seamless communication with the EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service for snapshot identification and deletion.

### Snapshot Cleanup Logic: 
The Lambda function is designed to identify snapshots that are not attached to any volumes or instances. By implementing custom logic, the solution ensures that only unused snapshots are targeted for deletion.

### Automated Execution: 
The Lambda function is triggered on a scheduled basis, allowing for automated and regular execution of the snapshot management process. This ensures that the AWS environment remains optimized over time.

### Logging and Monitoring: 
The project incorporates logging mechanisms to capture relevant information about the execution of the Lambda function. Additionally, CloudWatch, AWS's monitoring and observability service, can be configured to provide insights into the execution and performance of the solution.

### Cost Optimization: 
By automating the identification and deletion of unattached snapshots, the project contributes to cost optimization within AWS, as unnecessary storage costs are reduced.
